# TextureExtractorCode

Code base for extraction of realistic textures for user avatars from RGB streams.

The target of the VIRTOOAIR framework is the reconstruction of users' avatars for VR applications based on RGB and tracking input data.

We take the silhouette of the user in the RGB stream as a given and can therefore easily extract the relevant pixel data for the
user. Furthermore, there exists a corresponding 3D model of the user's avatar in the correct pose. The environment is homogeneously well-lit.

The goal for the thesis is to create a UV-mappable texture for the 3D avatar from the 2D pixel-based color information.
